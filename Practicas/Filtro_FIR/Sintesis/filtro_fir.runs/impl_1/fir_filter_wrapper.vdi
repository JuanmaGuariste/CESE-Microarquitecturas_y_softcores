opt_design failed
ERROR: [Opt 31-65] LUT input is undriven either due to a missing connection from a design error, or a connection removed during opt_design. LUT cell name: fir_filter_i/ila_0/U0/ila_core_inst/probeDelay1[4]_i_1
Resolution: The design must be restored to its state before opt_design for proper debugging. If you are using a project, open the Synthesized Design. If you are using non-project mode, load the pre-opt_design checkpoint. Check for undriven LUT inputs as mentioned in previous error messages and correct the design as needed. To display a list of all optimized design objects, re-run opt_design with the -verbose option and use set_msg_config to set the message limit to a sufficiently high number.
